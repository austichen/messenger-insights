# messenger-insights

CLI tool to calculate and display cool stats about your messenger history ðŸ‘€

## Usage

1. [Download your Facebook Messenger data](https://www.zapptales.com/en/download-facebook-messenger-chat-history-how-to/). Extract the files to a directory of your choice. After you're done, your directory should have the following structure:
```
D:/your/path/to/facebook-data
â”œâ”€â”€ archived_threads
â”œâ”€â”€ filtered_threads
â”œâ”€â”€ inbox
â”œâ”€â”€ message_requests
â”œâ”€â”€ stickers_used
```

2. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/austichen/messenger-insights.git
cd messenger-insights
```

3. In the `/utils/constants.py` file, change the `FB_DATA_DIRECTORY` variable to be the absolute path to the directory you specified in step 1. Using my example in step 1, I would update it to `FB_DATA_DIRECTORY='D:/yourpath/to/facebook-data'`

4. In the root directory of `messenger-insights`, run
```
python setup.py
```
Your messenger data folder should be updated with two new folders, `raw` and `partitioned`:
```
D:/your/path/to/facebook-data
â”œâ”€â”€ archived_threads
â”œâ”€â”€ filtered_threads
â”œâ”€â”€ inbox
â”œâ”€â”€ message_requests
â”œâ”€â”€ stickers_used
â”œâ”€â”€ raw
â”œâ”€â”€ partitioned
```

5. Again in the root directory of `messenger-insights`, run
```
python insights-cli.py
```

Enter the appropriate commands to view the data you want to see!
